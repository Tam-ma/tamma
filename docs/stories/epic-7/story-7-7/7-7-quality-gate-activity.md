# Story 7-7: Mentorship Quality Gate Activity

## User Story

As an **autonomous mentorship system**, I need quality gate checks tailored to mentored work so that code review includes teaching feedback, test verification is pedagogically constructive, and quality standards progressively increase as the junior's skill level improves.

## Description

Extend the existing `QualityGateCheckActivity` in the ELSA/.NET codebase with mentorship-aware quality checking. The current implementation runs standard quality gates (tests, coverage, build, linting, static analysis) and returns pass/fail results. This story adds skill-level-aware thresholds, teaching-oriented feedback, progressive quality standards, and integration with `ClaudeAnalysisActivity` for AI-powered code review with educational commentary. The activity should not just identify issues but explain *why* they matter and *how* to fix them in a way that builds understanding.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Skill-Level-Aware Quality Thresholds
- [ ] Define quality thresholds per skill level (1-5):
  - Level 1: Coverage >= 60%, warnings allowed, relaxed lint rules
  - Level 2: Coverage >= 70%, minor warnings allowed
  - Level 3: Coverage >= 80%, standard lint rules (current default)
  - Level 4: Coverage >= 85%, strict lint rules
  - Level 5: Coverage >= 90%, zero warnings, full static analysis
- [ ] Thresholds are configurable per project
- [ ] Thresholds automatically adjust as junior's skill level changes
- [ ] Record which threshold tier was applied to each quality gate run

### AC2: Teaching-Oriented Code Review
- [ ] Integrate with `ClaudeAnalysisActivity` using `AnalysisType.CodeReview`
- [ ] Generate review comments that explain the "why" behind each issue
- [ ] Provide concrete before/after code examples for each issue
- [ ] Categorize review feedback: `MustFix`, `ShouldFix`, `NiceToHave`, `LearningOpportunity`
- [ ] Limit feedback volume to avoid overwhelming the junior (max 5 `MustFix`, 3 `ShouldFix`, 3 `LearningOpportunity`)
- [ ] Adapt explanation complexity to junior's skill level
- [ ] Include positive reinforcement for well-written code sections

### AC3: Test Verification with Guidance
- [ ] Verify tests exist for all new/modified code
- [ ] Check test quality (not just presence): meaningful assertions, edge cases, error paths
- [ ] If tests are missing, generate test suggestions via `SuggestionGeneratorActivity`
- [ ] Provide test template examples relevant to the code being tested
- [ ] Check for common test anti-patterns (testing implementation details, no assertions, etc.)
- [ ] Report test coverage per file, not just aggregate

### AC4: Progressive Quality Standards
- [ ] Track quality gate results across sessions for each junior
- [ ] Automatically tighten thresholds when junior consistently passes (3 consecutive passes)
- [ ] Relax thresholds temporarily after a skill regression detection
- [ ] Show progress toward next quality tier in feedback
- [ ] Award "quality badges" for milestones (first 80% coverage, zero lint errors, etc.)

### AC5: Style and Convention Checking
- [ ] Verify code follows project-specific style conventions
- [ ] Check naming conventions (variable, function, class names)
- [ ] Check file organization and module structure
- [ ] Check for consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Provide style guide references for each violation
- [ ] Auto-fix formatting issues when possible (via `AUTO_FIX_ISSUES` state)

### AC6: Security and Best Practices
- [ ] Check for common security issues (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS)
- [ ] Verify proper input validation
- [ ] Check for proper error handling (no swallowed exceptions)
- [ ] Verify async/await usage correctness
- [ ] Check for potential performance issues (N+1 queries, missing indexes)
- [ ] Adapt security checks to skill level (basic for level 1-2, full for level 4-5)

### AC7: Quality Gate Reporting
- [ ] Generate structured quality report with overall score (0-100)
- [ ] Break down score by category: Tests, Coverage, Build, Lint, Style, Security
- [ ] Include improvement suggestions ranked by impact
- [ ] Track quality score trend over time per junior
- [ ] Deliver report via Slack with summary and link to full details
- [ ] Record all quality gate data in `IAnalyticsService`

## Technical Design

)]
public class MentorshipQualityGateActivity : CodeActivity<MentorshipQualityGateOutput>
{
    [Input(Description = "Mentorship session ID")]
    public Input<Guid> SessionId { get; set; } = default!;

    [Input(Description = "ID of the story being checked")]
    public Input<string> StoryId { get; set; } = default!;

## Dependencies

- Story 7-1: Mentorship State Machine Core (state transitions: `QUALITY_GATE_CHECK`, `AUTO_FIX_ISSUES`, `PREPARE_CODE_REVIEW`)
- Story 7-4: Claude Analysis Activity (`ClaudeAnalysisActivity` for AI code review)
- Existing `QualityGateCheckActivity` in `apps/tamma-elsa/src/Tamma.Activities/Mentorship/`
- Existing `SuggestionGeneratorActivity` for test suggestions
- `IIntegrationService` for build/test/coverage data

- [ ] Gate result aggregation with mentorship thresholds
- [ ] Teaching feedback generation for each issue category
- [ ] Positive reinforcement selection logic
- [ ] Progressive tier upgrade/downgrade logic
- [ ] Badge earning criteria validation
- [ ] Feedback volume limiting (max per category)
- [ ] Score calculation formula accuracy

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full quality gate flow with real test/build data via `IIntegrationService`
- [ ] AI code review via `ClaudeAnalysisActivity` integration
- [ ] Progressive threshold tracking across multiple sessions
- [ ] Badge awarding persistence via `IAnalyticsService`

### Edge Case Tests
- [ ] No repository URL configured (simulated results)
- [ ] All gates pass on first attempt
- [ ] All gates fail on first attempt
- [ ] Skill level changes between quality gate runs
- [ ] Concurrent quality gate runs for same junior on different stories
