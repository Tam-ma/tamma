- **Issue Preview Panel**: Detailed view of selected and candidate issues
- **Configuration Templates**: Pre-built filtering strategies for different workflows
- **Activity Timeline**: Historical view of issue selections and outcomes

---

## 📋 Core UI Components

### 1. Issue Selection Pipeline Dashboard

**Main Visualization**:

```typescript
interface SelectionPipeline {
  status: 'active' | 'idle' | 'paused' | 'error';
  currentIssue: SelectedIssue | null;
  queueLength: number;
  processingRate: number; // issues per hour
  lastSelection: Date | null;
  nextCheck: Date | null;
  filters: FilterConfig;
  strategy: PriorityStrategy;
}
```

**Visual Elements**:

- **Pipeline Flow Diagram**: Shows issue flow from repository → filtering → prioritization → selection
- **Real-time Status Indicators**: Animated progress bars and status lights
- **Metrics Cards**: Key performance indicators (selection rate, success rate, processing time)
- **Control Panel**: Start/stop/pause controls with manual override options

### 2. Advanced Filter Configuration Interface

**Filter Builder**:

```typescript
interface FilterConfig {
  repositories: RepositoryFilter[];
  labels: LabelFilter;
  assignees: AssigneeFilter;
  age: AgeFilter;
  complexity: ComplexityFilter;
  customRules: CustomRule[];
}

interface LabelFilter {
  include: string[];
  exclude: string[];
  requireAll: boolean;
  caseSensitive: boolean;
}
```

**Interactive Filter Builder**:

- **Visual Rule Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating complex filter rules
- **Label Management**: Auto-suggestion for existing labels, color coding, bulk operations
- **Repository Selection**: Multi-repository support with organization-level filtering
- **Real-time Preview**: Live count of issues matching current filter criteria
- **Filter Templates**: Pre-built templates (Bug Triage, Feature Backlog, Security Issues, etc.)

### 3. Priority Strategy Configuration

**Strategy Selection Interface**:

```typescript
interface PriorityStrategy {
  type: 'oldest' | 'newest' | 'updated' | 'complexity' | 'custom';
  weights: StrategyWeights;
  customRules: CustomPriorityRule[];
  tieBreaker: TieBreakerRule;
}

interface StrategyWeights {
  age: number; // 0-100
  complexity: number;
  priority: number;
  teamVelocity: number;
  businessValue: number;
}
```

**Visual Strategy Builder**:

- **Strategy Selector**: Radio buttons for preset strategies with visual previews
- **Weight Adjustment Sliders**: Interactive sliders for custom strategy weights
- **Rule Editor**: Advanced interface for custom priority rules
- **Simulation Mode**: Test strategy against historical data to predict outcomes

### 4. Issue Preview and Management Panel

**Issue Card Display**:

```typescript
interface IssueCard {
  issue: GitHubIssue;
  selectionScore: number;
  matchReason: string[];
  estimatedEffort: EffortEstimate;
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  teamAvailability: TeamAvailability;
}
```

**Features**:

- **Candidate Issues Grid**: Scrollable grid of issues matching current filters
- **Selection Score Display**: Visual indicators showing why issues are prioritized
- **Quick Actions**: Select now, skip, block, or manually prioritize individual issues
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select for batch operations (skip, label, assign)
- **Issue Details Modal**: Comprehensive view with all relevant metadata

### 5. Manual Override Interface

**Override Controls**:

```typescript
interface ManualOverride {
  type: 'select' | 'skip' | 'pause' | 'reconfigure';
  targetIssue?: string;
  reason: string;
  temporary: boolean;
  duration?: number; // minutes
}
```

**Override Features**:

- **Emergency Stop**: Immediate pause of autonomous selection
- **Manual Selection**: Force selection of specific issue
- **Temporary Rules**: Apply one-time filters or priority adjustments
- **Reason Tracking**: Required justification for manual overrides
- **Rollback Capability**: Revert manual overrides and resume autonomous operation

- **Data Visualization**: Use charts, graphs, and flow diagrams for complex data
- **Status Indicators**: Universal color coding (green=active, yellow=warning, red=error, blue=manual)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show relevant information based on user role and context

### Component Library

- **Filter Builder Components**: Reusable rule builders and condition editors
- **Data Visualization Components**: Charts, timelines, and pipeline diagrams
- **Issue Card Components**: Standardized issue display with consistent metadata
- **Control Panel Components**: Start/stop/pause controls with consistent styling

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

```typescript
const IssueSelectionDashboard: React.FC = () => {
  const [pipeline, setPipeline] = useState<SelectionPipeline | null>(null);
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState<FilterConfig>(defaultFilters);
  const [strategy, setStrategy] = useState<PriorityStrategy>(defaultStrategy);
  const [selectedIssues, setSelectedIssues] = useState<string[]>([]);

  return (
    <div className="issue-selection-dashboard">
      <PipelineStatus
        pipeline={pipeline}
        onPause={handlePause}
        onResume={handleResume}
        onManualOverride={handleManualOverride}
      />
      <div className="dashboard-content">
        <FilterConfiguration
          filters={filters}
          onChange={setFilters}
          repositories={availableRepositories}
        />
        <PriorityStrategyConfig
          strategy={strategy}
          onChange={setStrategy}
        />
        <IssuePreviewPanel
          filters={filters}
          strategy={strategy}
          selectedIssues={selectedIssues}
          onIssueSelect={handleIssueSelect}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Real-time Data Integration

```typescript
class IssueSelectionWebSocket {
  private ws: WebSocket;

  connect() {
    this.ws = new WebSocket('/ws/issue-selection');
    this.ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
      switch (data.type) {
        case 'pipeline_status':
          this.updatePipelineStatus(data.payload);
          break;
        case 'issue_selected':
          this.handleNewSelection(data.payload);
          break;
        case 'filter_match':
          this.updateCandidateIssues(data.payload);
          break;
      }
    };
  }
}
```

### State Management

```typescript
interface DashboardState {
  pipeline: SelectionPipeline;
  filters: FilterConfig;
  strategy: PriorityStrategy;
  candidateIssues: IssueCard[];
  selectedIssue: SelectedIssue | null;
  manualOverrides: ManualOverride[];
  analytics: SelectionAnalytics;
  loading: Record<string, boolean>;
  errors: Record<string, string>;
